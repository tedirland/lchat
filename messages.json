This is because the distance between Earth and Proxima Centauri b is approximately 4.2 light-years. However, it is important to note that according to our current understanding of physics, objects with mass cannot reach or exceed the speed of light. The theory of relativity states that as an object with mass approaches the speed of light, its mass would increase, requiring infinite energy to reach the speed of light. Thus, the idea of traveling at the speed of light is currently considered impractical based on our current scientific knowledge.",
